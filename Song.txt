I'm right here, boss man
I got this here
Can't be touched, can't be stopped
Can't be moved, can't be rocked
Can't be shook, we hot
When will you niggas learn?
Came to get crunk, came to bring life
Came to get it started, came to get it right
Turn down the music, turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn?
I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle, I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimping my hoes, I'm jacking my foes
I spit at police and duck my POs
I ain't going to court, you can call the judge
Tell him kiss my ass, 'cause I ain't gonna budge
And I ain't going back to lock up
You try and the Glock'll pop up
I ain't going back to broke
And I'm never gonna stop the puffing, not for nothing
The block, they need me, the streets they need me
The club scene, nigga, is mine, believe me
You don't believe me?
